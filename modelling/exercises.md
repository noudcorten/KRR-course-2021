# Exercises for modelling and solving problems

This is a list of problems that you can use for practicing how to model and solve a problem using ASP. When practicing, keep in mind the [guide](guide.md) of steps to take in the modelling process.

The problems in this list originate in a variety of areas. Some are already defined formally, and others less so. The problems are grouped into several categories, based on their type or flavor.

For each problem, the difficulty of modelling it using ASP is indicated using one to four stars (&star;'s)&mdash;one start being the easiest, and four stars being the hardest.

The problem descriptions below both indicate what is the input for the problem, what kind of object the solutions are and what kind of properties the solutions should have. The goal, for each exercise, is to construct an answer set program *P* such that the (optimal) answer sets of *P* correspond to the solutions of the problem&mdash;and to describe how one can extract solutions from the (optimal) answer sets.

*Tip:* To check your solution, construct an example input, and check if the (optimal) answer sets for your program correspond to correct solutions for this input.

### D.2. Combinatorial auctions

*Input:* a set *I* of items, and a set of bids, each consisting of a subset *J &subseteq; I* of items and a profit *p* (a positive integer). (The bids are offers for selling the items in *J* together for profit *p*.)

*Solutions:* a subset of bids that are mutually consistent (that is, bids involving separate subsets of items) that lead to a maximum combined profit.

*Note:* this exercise involves using the aggregate `#sum` as well as an optimization statement.

### D.3. Shortest task schedule

*Solutions:* a schedule of minimum length (i.e., a minimum number of days) for which tasks to do on which day, so that each task is done on exactly one day, and such that for each pair *(t<sub>j</sub>,i<sub>j</sub>) &in; P* it holds that task *t<sub>j</sub>* is done on a different day than day *i<sub>j</sub>*.

*Note 1:* this exercise involves an optimization statement.

*Note 2:* an [example solution](./example%20solutions/shortest-task-schedule.lp) for this exercise is available.
